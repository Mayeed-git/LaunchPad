## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

1. **Repository Submission** - User submits Git repository URL
2. **Job Queuing** - Deployment job added to Redis queue
3. **File Retrieval** - Repository cloned and files uploaded to R2
4. **Build Processing** - Smart detection of project type and build execution
5. **Asset Deployment** - Built files distributed to CDN
6. **URL Generation** - Dynamic subdomain created for live access
7. **Status Notification** - Real-time updates throughout process
